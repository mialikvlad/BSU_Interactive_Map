### Additional information about project
#### Keywords: DEVELOPMENT, ANDROID, KOTLIN, MOBILE APP, WORK MANAGER, RETROFIT, ROOM DB, KOIN, OPENSTRREETMAP, MAPBOX.
#### Object of research — various android development technologies related to the creation of work in the background, dependency injection, the introduction of multithreading and the creation of a database, as well as technologies for developing interactive maps OpenStreetMap and Mapbox.
#### Subject of research — the ability to embed android technologies and technologies for developing interactive maps in one project.
#### Purpose — familiarization of applicants, students, teachers with the history of the university, providing historical and modern data in order to spread the century-old history of the university, using the history of the university to develop tourism, increasing the prestige of BSU as a whole.
#### Result — a mobile application for the Android operating system was implemented, which works with Mapbox technology and displays information about the sights of BSU.
#### Application area — this application may be useful for tourists or for those who wish to get acquainted with the history of BSU.
#### This application is being developed as part of my graduation project at university. The essence of the project is to create a mobile application for Android, inside which the user will be able to work with an interactive map, which shows various sights and buildings of BSU. The unique feature of this particular project is that it describes the history of various attractions specifically at BSU, it is planned to add a mode of excursions, routes and even augmented reality, as well as an interactive mode for displaying objects on the map depending on the selected year (for example, 1941 or 2022). Three people are responsible for this project, including me. One of them is responsible for the web application, the second is for the iOS application, and I am for the android application.
